## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI with Python 3.11
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage
- **Deployment**: Docker, Railway, Render

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Quick Start

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Mobile Setup

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npm start
```

See [mobile/README.md](mobile/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment.

### Workflows

#### Backend CI/CD (`..github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`)
- Triggers on push/PR to `main` and `develop` branches
- Runs on changes to `backend/**` files
- **Test Job**:
  - Python 3.11 setup with dependency caching
  - flake8 linting
  - black code formatting check
  - pytest with coverage reporting
- **Deploy Job** (main branch only):
  - Automated deployment to Railway/Render

#### Mobile CI/CD (`..github/workflows/mobile-ci.yml`)
- Triggers on push/PR to `main` and `develop` branches
- Runs on changes to `mobile/**` files
- **Test Job**:
  - Node.js 18 setup with dependency caching
  - ESLint linting
  - TypeScript type checking
  - Jest tests with coverage reporting
- **Build Job** (main branch only):
  - EAS build for Android APK

#### Full CI (`..github/workflows/full-ci.yml`)
- Runs both backend and mobile CI in parallel
- Detects changes and runs relevant workflows
- Reports overall status

### Dependency Management

Dependabot is configured to automatically update dependencies:
- Backend Python packages (weekly on Mondays)
- Frontend NPM packages (weekly on Mondays)
- GitHub Actions versions (weekly on Mondays)

## Testing

cd backend
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
flake8 app
black --check app
```

### Frontend Testing

```bash
cd mobile
npm test
npm run lint
npm run type-check
```

## Docker Support
